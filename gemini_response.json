    "summary": "The video ranks 20 popular back exercises from best to worst for muscle growth, evaluating them based on stretch, tension, feel, and progression potential. The video criticizes exercises that combine back work with other muscle groups, like renegade rows, and two-in-one combination exercises, due to the weaker muscle group limiting back stimulation. Deadlifts are acknowledged for building total body strength but placed in C tier for back-specific hypertrophy due to limited stretch and tension on the lats and mid-back. The video praises exercises like wide-grip pull-ups, neutral-grip pull-ups, various lat pulldown variations (wide-grip, neutral-grip, and half-kneeling one-arm), barbell rows, Pendlay rows, Meadows rows, and chest-supported rows for their effectiveness in back development. Inverted rows, dumbbell rows, and T-bar rows are discussed with their pros and cons, while cable lat pullovers and dumbbell lat pullovers are recommended for extra lat isolation volume. Ultimately, the chest-supported row is crowned as the best overall back exercise, while the renegade row is considered the least effective.",
